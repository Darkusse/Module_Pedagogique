The MEILO Project


The objective of our application is to allow teachers to write the learning outcome, using a wording provided on our site
to share it with the other teachers for the evaluation and to give their appreciations (formulation of learning outcomes)
thus communicate proposals that enrich our database.




With "MEILO" the teacher will be able to:


DRAW UP: Create a learning course.

PARTNER: Evaluator by other users and know their opinion.

COMMUNICATE: Navigate the Bloom Taxonomy proposals.
